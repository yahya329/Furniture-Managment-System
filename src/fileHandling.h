// TASK: fileHandling.h - File Management
// ============================

/*
- Implement functions to read and write user data from/to a file:
  - Read user credentials (username and password) from a storage file.
  - Write new user credentials to the file after successful registration.

- Ensure data is stored persistently in the correct file format (e.g., text file or binary file).

- Handle file errors gracefully:
  - If the file cannot be opened, display a meaningful error message.
  - Ensure the program does not crash on file read/write errors.

- Implement file closing:
  - Always ensure files are properly closed after reading or writing operations.
